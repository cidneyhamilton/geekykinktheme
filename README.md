Geeky Kink Theme
====================

WordPress theme source code for [The Geeky Kink Event](http://thegeekykinkevent.com) and [The Geeky Kink Event: New England).

This is a lightweight child theme, most of the logic is in  [jme-event-base-theme](https://github.com/jeffmachevents/jme-event-base-theme).

How to Install
=================

* Setup WordPress locally or on a remote service. I use [Vagrant](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV) locally.
* Install the parent theme, [jme-event-base-theme](https://github.com/jeffmachevents/jme-event-base-theme)
* Customize! Add headers, a background graphic, modify the color scheme as needed.
